Depricated Mod for Grand Theft auto V to add accessibility for blind gamers

## What is it?

GTA11Y was an attempt to create functions for the popular Grand Theft auto V game to promote accessibility for blind gamers. Though the mod was successful, I am both unable and unwilling to continue development. I am placing the sourcecode here for those who care to tinker with it.

But I am providing the code at the insistance of community members. if you can do something coolw ith it then be my guest. I do however ask that you refrain from contacting me. I will not provide support nor will I answer questions regarding the project. this is being kept here for historical purposes if nothing else.
